This repository has python files I used for my bachelor thesis (Braids as a product of binary-binary scattering), which should eventually be uploaded to the bachelor thesis repository of the astronomy and/or math bachelors at Leiden university. 

single_triple_forloop.py is the most important file. It generates the main result in the thesis: a plot of all initial positions for the incoming body, marked by whether they generate a double binary or not.

braid_image.py simply generates a plot of the investigated braid.

reversed_interaction.py generates the other result of the bachelor thesis, investigating reversibility. It includes an option to make it an animation.
